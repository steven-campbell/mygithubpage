		<h1>Steven Campbell: 2018 SAA Application Creative Piece</h1>
		<p>For many years, I have been obsessed with fractals, the patterns they show and reveal, their connections to nature, and how math connects to nature in these beatiful designs. </p>
		<p>If you don't know much about fractals, they all share some common qualities, like self-similarity and a pictorial representation. </p>

		<p>Looking at this tree and adjusting some parameters, I noticed some things with self-similarity and changing some of the parameters. Trees are often good metaphors for life, and this fractal tree is no exception.</p>
