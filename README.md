# Introduction

Hi, I'm Steve Campbell and I'm proud to be running for Virginia Tech Class of 2021 President. 

# Why I'm Running

I'd like to become more involved in Virginia Tech since I enjoyed my first semester here at Tech so much! I want to give back to Virginia Tech so that our class and future classes can enjoy their time here at Tech to the fullest. I would love to lead our class through many of the amazing traditions that occur at Tech, from football games to Relay for Life, and the fantastic Ring Dance during our junior year!
