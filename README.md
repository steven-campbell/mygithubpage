# Introduction

Hi, I'm Steve Campbell and I'm a freshman studying engineering at Virginia Tech. 

# What I Do

I work to help people make the most of the world they find themselves in. This involves working with connections to find opportunities and open doors.

I work with other college students to optimize their brand recognition on paper, in person, and on social media.

Services I provide include:
Resume design and review
Website creation
Social media branding
Interview preparation

I am most experienced in engineering fields, but can give other fields a try.
